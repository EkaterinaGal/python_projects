Banking Project

This is my first ML project

Project objective:
Identify 100 clients who are most likely to accept one of the marketing offers from the bank:
·  	MF (mutual fund)
·  	CC (credit card)
·  	CL (customer loan)
 
 Prediction model should answer the following questions:
 
• Who are the clients more likely to accept a consumer loan offer?
• Who are the clients more likely to accept a credit card offer?
• Who are the clients more likely to accept a mutual fund offer?
• Which are the 100 top clients to target with bank offers? What offers (MF, CC or CL)?
 
The data includes 3 types of marketing offers and the revenue generated by these offers. This makes it a supervised classification machine learning task:
 
• Supervised: we have access to the features and the target and our aim is to train a model that can learn a mapping between the two.
• Classification: we need to predict which type of offer a customer will accept (MF, CC or CL).
